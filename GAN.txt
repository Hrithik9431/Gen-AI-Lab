1.	Design a Generator network that converts random noise vectors into images.
2.	Design a Discriminator network that classifies images as real or fake.
3.	Train the GAN for the given number of epochs using alternating training of Discriminator and Generator.
4.	Generate and save synthetic images periodically during training.
5.	Predict the labels of generated images using a pre-trained classifier model (transfer learning) and report label distribution.
